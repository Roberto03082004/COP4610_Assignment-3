Writing instructions for running the program

1. Ensure you have the required files in the same directory:
   - `memory_management.c` (C source file)
   - `Makefile` (build file)

2. Compile the program using the Makefile:
   Open a terminal in the directory containing the files and run:
       make

3. Run the program:
   After successful compilation, execute the program using:
       make run

4. Follow the program output to see memory allocation, deallocation, and fragmentation analysis.

5. Clean up compiled files (optional):
   To remove the executable and other build artifacts, run:
       make clean
